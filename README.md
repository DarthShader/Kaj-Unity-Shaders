This is a collection of VRChat-centric Unity shaders and shader utilities.  Documentation in progress.

## Kaj Shader Editor
Procedural inspector that serves as a functionally complete foundation for all shaders; meant to build upon the default material inspector to reach all possible material/shader settings without shader-specific logic.

## Kaj Shader Optimizer
Preprocessor that generates a new shader for a specific material, assuming most/all of its properties are constant.  Mega shaders can now be made efficient without having to use `shader_feature` and `multi_compile` keywords.

## Omega Shader
(Previously named PBR) Modular Physically Based Rendering mega shader that aims to provide the features Unity's HDRP Lit shader provides (and beyond), but on the standard rendering pipeline.  Forward Rendering/Shader Model 5.0 only.

## Nothing Shader
A small utility shader/material with no passes, thanks to disabled LightModes.  Perfect for material swapping on meshes without adding draw calls.
